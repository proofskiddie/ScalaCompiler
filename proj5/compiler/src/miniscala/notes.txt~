Use helper methods in CPSValueRepresenter, CPSTreeModule.Tree

use << and >> to implement multiplication and division by 2

Can pass Map

The value conversion phase takes a CPS program with high level primitives and out puts a program where all values are either integers, pointers or primitives corresponding to instructions on a microprocessor

CPSLow code defined in CPS Primitives

CPSLow semantics in CPSInterpreter.scala

optimize shape of tree using miniscala.test.CPSValueRepresentatoin_Whitebox

tips :
   manually transform code to test understanding, write out test cases
   implement value transformation first
   closure conversion last
